# Market Yard - Progressive Web Application

## 📱 Project Overview

Market Yard is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React.js and TypeScript, designed to solve price discovery and comparison challenges in local market yards. The app connects shop owners, retailers, and individual buyers in a centralized platform for transparent pricing and efficient purchasing decisions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Market yards in cities have numerous shops selling fruits, vegetables, farming materials, and products. Prices change daily and vary across shops, making it difficult for buyers to:
- Compare prices across multiple shops
- Make informed purchasing decisions
- Avoid time-consuming phone calls or visits to multiple shops

Shop owners also face challenges:
- Answering repeated price inquiries from multiple customers
- Managing daily price updates manually
- Losing potential customers due to lack of visibility

## 💡 Solution

Market Yard automates the entire price discovery process through a progressive web application where:
- **Shop owners** can update daily prices and earn incentives (₹1 per update)
- **End users** can browse and compare prices across all shops
- **Free users** get basic price ranges and best value information
- **Premium users** get detailed shop-specific prices, insights, and advanced features

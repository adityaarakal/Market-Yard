# Market Yard - Project Description

## Problem Statement

Market Yard is a bustling marketplace in our city with numerous shops selling products like fruits, vegetables, farming materials, and farming products. The core challenges faced are:

1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices of products change on a daily basis
2. **Price Fragmentation**: No unity among market yard shops, causing prices to vary from shop to shop
3. **Inefficient Price Discovery**: Currently, retailers and individuals must:
   - Call each shop owner individually to enquire about prices
   - Visit shops physically to compare prices and decide where to buy
4. **Operational Overhead**: 
   - Buyers find it hectic to decide where to buy from
   - Shop owners are overwhelmed answering price inquiries from multiple customers daily

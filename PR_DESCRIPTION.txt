# fix: Fix GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## Overview

This PR fixes the GitHub Pages deployment workflow that was failing due to build errors.

## Issue

The GitHub Pages deployment was failing because:
- Build step was treating ESLint warnings as errors (CI=true by default)
- Using `npm install` instead of `npm ci` for consistency

## Fix

- Added `CI=false` to build step to allow warnings (matching PR checks workflow)
- Changed `npm install` to `npm ci` for faster, reliable installs
- Ensures deployment works correctly with existing warnings

## Version Bump

**Current Version**: `0.1.2` -> `0.1.3` (PATCH increment)

This is a PATCH increment because:
- Bug fix for deployment workflow
- No breaking changes
- No new features

## Ready for Review

This PR fixes the GitHub Pages deployment issue and ensures the site deploys correctly.
